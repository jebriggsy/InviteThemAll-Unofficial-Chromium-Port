InviteThemAll-Unofficial-Chromium-Port
======================================

This is an unofficial port of the GreaseMonkey userscript, InviteThemAll, to the Chromium extension format.

To install, clone or download the source from GitHub and use the Extensions tab in Chrome's settings
under developer mode to load a folder.

Or you could download the self installing file. You'll have to bear with the untrusted warning - I
haven't paid Google yet. It is available at:
