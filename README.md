InviteThemAll-Unofficial-Chromium-Port
======================================

This is an unofficial port of the GreaseMonkey userscript, InviteThemAll, to the Chromium extension format.

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Go to the "Downloads" portion of this site and download as a .zip
2. Create a folder somewhere and name it InviteThemAll or something else you'll remember
3. Extract the two files to that folder
4. Open Chrome and go to settings
5. Go to the Extensions tab
6. Enable/Check Developer mode and use the Extensions tab in Chrome's settings
7. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
8. Find the folder you created earlier and select it.
9. ???*
10. Profit!!


HOW TO USE*:

1. Go to the event page
2. Click invite friends
3. You should now see a new set of options below the friend search bar.  Your friends will be numbered.
4. You can select a range from 1 to all or just skip that and choose Select All
5. After a few seconds, all of your friends will be selected for invitation
6. Hit save 
7. You may need to solve a CAPTCHA.
8. Done

If you encounter an error, try first to lower the amount of friends
you are inviting.  You may be hitting Facebook's anti-spam protection
if you have a huge friend's list! 

Sorry for the somewhat involved installation, I am currently working on getting this on the app store.
